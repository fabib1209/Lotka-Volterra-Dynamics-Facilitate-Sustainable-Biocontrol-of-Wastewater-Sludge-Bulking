# Descriptions and explanations for the Datasets

Each dataset uses different categories for describing the organisms. Here we list the categories for each dataset.

## Dataset 1
### Categories
Filament density and bacteria abundance: 1-4 (single, some, frequent, mass)

Eukaryotes: 1 = 1-5 organisms; 2 = 6-10; 3 = >10;

## Dataset 2
### Categories
Filament density: 1-7 (see Pinther et al. 2022)

Eukaryotes: 1 = single specimens; 2 = few; 3 = few to medium number; 4 = medium number; 5 = medium to many; 6 = many; 7 = masses

## Dataset 3 & 4
### Categories 
Filament density: 1-7 (see Pinther et al. 2022)

Bacteria abundance: 1-10

Eukaryotes: 1 = 1-5 organisms; 2 = 6-10; 3 = >10;

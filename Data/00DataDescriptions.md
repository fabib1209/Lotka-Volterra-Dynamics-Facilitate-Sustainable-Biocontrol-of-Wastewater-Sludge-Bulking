# Descriptions and explanations for the Datasets

Each dataset uses different categories for describing the organisms. Here we list the categories for each dataset.

## Dataset 1
### Categories
Filament density and bacteria abundance: 1-4 (single, some, frequent, mass)

Eukaryotes: 1 = 1-5 organisms; 2 = 6-10; 3 = >10;

## Dataset 2
### Categories
Filament density and bacteria abundance: 1-7 (see Pinther et al. 2022)

Eukaryotes: 1 = single specimens; 2 = few; 3 = few to medium number; 4 = medium number; 5 = medium to many; 6 = many; 7 = masses

## Dataset 3 & 4
### Categories 
Filament density: 1-7 (see Pinther et al. 2022)

Bacteria abundance: 1-10

Eukaryotes: 1 = 1-5 organisms; 2 = 6-10; 3 = >10;


## Experimental data (new)
This repository contains data from a controlled laboratory microcosm experiment investigating the effect of temperature and Arcella spp. addition on sludge bulking dynamics. The experiment was designed to test how protozoan predation (Arcella) influences microbial community composition and sludge settleability under different temperature regimes (13°C and 20°C). The dataset includes time-series measurements of biomass growth and other relevant variables across treatments and time points.
